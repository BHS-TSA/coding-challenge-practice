'''
Write a program which takes a sentence and determines if it is a pangram
(contains each character in the alphabet at least once).
Example, “A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog” results in “is a pangram.”
If the sentence is not a pangram, the output should be the list of letters which are not present.
