# Coding Challenge Example
* Write a program which takes an integer input and outputs the corresponding text. Example, “123” results in “one two three.”
* Write a program which takes an integer input and determines if it is a prime number. Example, “97” results in “is a prime number.”
* Write a program which takes a sentence and determines if it is a pangram (contains each character in the alphabet at least once). Example, “A quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog” results in “is a pangram.” If the sentence is not a pangram, the output should be the list of letters which are not present.
* Write a program which takes two inputs, a time and an offset (positive or negative, in hours and minutes), and output the resulting time. Example, “10:00 PM” and “+2:30” results in “12:30 AM.”  Or “8:15 AM” and “-12:00” results in “8:15 PM.”
